# Regression Methods
## Learn Regression Methods Once For All

These scripts are based on the lecture notes from STAT 501 - Regression Methods.
This is a course from Pennsylvania State University ( Penn State ).

## Lesson 01 - Simple Linear Regression
This notes describes the basic concepts about a simple linear regression. 
How to measure the strength of linear association between the features and 
How to interpret the coefficient of determination ( Rsquare )

### What is the "Best Fitting Line"??
- The Best Line would be the line the presents the prediction errors as small as possible in some overall sense
- **Least Squares Criterios**: Minimize the sum of the squared prediction errors.
- **Error ( Residual )**: y - yhat

### The Simple Linear Regression Model
The Simple linear regression model fits the four conditions below:
- The mean of the response, at each value of the predictor, is a **Linear function** of the x
- The errors are **Independent**
- The errors, at each value of the predictor, are **Normallly Distribuited**
- The errors, at each value of the predictor, have **Equal Variance**
